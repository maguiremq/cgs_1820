=======================
Disruptive Technologies
=======================

- Makes old products obsolete
- Destroys old industry
- Affects social order, law, and societal morals
- Less expensive
- Moves centralized power towards decentralizaton

- Internet replaced printing
- Printing was once disruptive to feudal system and church
- 1450's when Gutenburg started mass book production
- Power goes from church to publishers
- Disruptive to truth since internet contains opinions or statements that are untrue

- Internet started as means to send papers and data within CERN
- Invented by Tim Berners-Lee

==================
What is a browser?
==================

- Views web pages
- Application that renders web page by source HTML and CSS code
- Gets sent to frame buffer (video card)
- HTML5 in 2005 led to standards across browsing experience
- All browsers use W3C Document Object Model to describe page structure, style, and content, except for Microsoft Edge
- Browsers designed to convert invalid code to valid code

------------------
Browser Components 
------------------

- Browsers use series of engines/programming modules to display web page
- An engine is a block of code that performs a specific task
- Browser has rendering or layout engine that calculates pixel colors on frame buffer.

================================
Important Browser Considerations
================================

---------------------
Document Object Model
---------------------

-DOM not an engine but represents web page structure for rendering engine.

----------------------
Separation of Concerns
----------------------

- SOC calls for one file to hold only one type of scripting
- Principle shared in engineering disciplines
- Three types of scripting to make webpage
- HTML is also known as structure - it defines pages content
- Cascading Style Sheets/styling information are known as presentation - defines page
s appearance
- Javascript adds programming and dynamism to web pages

- Separation of concerns should be followed in HTML because browser parses code quickly

===================
Browsers Used Today
===================

- Chrome has 66% of market share.
- Most compliant with W3C standards.
- Requires each tab to run as separate instance

- Safari is second with 18% of market share.
- Mobile browsing not separated from desktop browsing

- Edge started as internet explorer
- Controversial because directly embedded in the Windows 95 OS.
- Has 5% of market share

- Firefox started as netscape navigator and dominated 1995 - 2000.
- Netscape navigator 2 important because it was the first browser to store cookies, allow Javascript, and it introduced SSL
- Replaced in 2004 for Firefox
- 3% of market share

=================================
The World of ECMAScript Companies
=================================

-------------------------------------
Technologies Relating to the Internet
-------------------------------------

- John Resig focused on UI, front-end development, and Javascript
- Created jQuery library and considered leading voice in Javascript development
- jQuery used by 10% of companies that need programming framework to use on site

- ECMA stands for European Computer Manufacturers Association and it is standardization organization where JavaScript and client-side scripting languages are documented

- Companies discussed are Adobe, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Opera

===================================
Early History of HTML (1960 - 1988)
===================================

---------------------------
Presentation of the History
---------------------------

- Internet Pre-History (1960 - 1988)
- The Internet @ CERN (1988 - 1993)
- The Internet Comes Home & Browser War Years (1995 - 1998)
- The XHTML Years (1998 - 2005)
- The HTML5 Years (2005 - present)

----------------------------------
Internet Pre-History (1960 - 1988)
----------------------------------

- Electronic computing came in WW2 by Alan Turing
- Alan Turing created electronic bombe to break German Enigma code
- Others developed Colossus which broke the code
- First programmable computer called ENIAC
- First computer using hard drive, RAM. and CPU - known as The von Neumann Architecture

---------------------------------------------------
Hardware, Networking, and the Intergalactic Network
---------------------------------------------------

- Hardware oriented project to see how to network computers
- Intergalactic Network used ARPANet to create networked systems in the 1980s
- JCR Licklider came up with above in the 60's
- Packet switching, ARAPNet, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) were key innovations

---------------------------
Software and Project Xanadu
---------------------------

- Xanadu was software=driven prject looking at how people would interact on network
- Ted Nelson responsible
- Came up with 17 core principles of the internet
- Nelson coined 'hypertext' and 'hypermedia', with hyper referring to multidimensional and non-sequential nature of consuming information
- Hyper also describes bridge/connection between two resources

-------------------------------
Invention of Personal Computers
-------------------------------

- Apple I first personal computer in 1975
- Gen 3 computer meaning it has OS and consistent architecture with chipset
- Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak added mouse and GUI to help users
- Jobs' metaphors: screen was desktop or working surface, we creat files and shown on paper pre-computer, files grouped together held in folders
- Memory icons are drawers or places of storage
- Unnecessary files are stored in trash

=======================
A New Metaphor of Media
=======================

-----------------------------
Project Zanadu and Hypermedia
-----------------------------

- Internet made by Tim Berners-Lee and intended opening on 01/01/1983
- Nelsons 17 principles for internet

- Every Xanadu server is uniquely and securely identiﬁed.
- Every Xanadu server can be operated independently or in a network.
- Users are uniquely and securely identiﬁed.
- Users can search, retrieve, create and store documents.
- Documents consist of any number of parts each of which may be of any data type.
- Documents contain links including virtual copies ("transclusions") to any other documents.
- Links are visible and can be followed from all endpoints.
- Permission to link to a document is explicitly granted by the act of publication.
- Documents can contain a royalty mechanism at any desired degree of granularity. 
- Documents are uniquely and securely identiﬁed.
- Documents can have secure access controls.
- Documents can be rapidly searched, stored and retrieved without user knowledge.
- Documents are moved to physical storage based on its frequency of access.
- Every document is stored redundantly to maintain availability.
- Service provides charge their users for the storage, retrieval and publishing of documents.
- Every transaction is secure and auditable only by the parties to that transaction.
- The Xanadu client-server communication protocol is an openly published standard. Third-party software development and integration is encouraged.

- Second theme of Nelson is idea that internet needs to develop own metaphors

====================================
What is Text? What is a Text Editor?
====================================

- HTML requires code using unformatted text typed into editor

----------------------
What is a text editor?
----------------------

- Creates files that hold unformatted text
- Word is a word-processor not a text editor

----------------
What is WYSIWYG?
----------------

- What you see is what you get
- Means display of file on monitor is same output generated when file is printed or viewed in another environment
- Word is one because file displayed on monitor and printed version look same

=============
Document Flow
=============

- How to place content on a page
- Applies to any element that has display of inline or inline-block
- Content goes horizontally left to right until it no longer fits on current row
- Line height determined by tallest element in row

============================
What an HTML File Looks Like
============================

---------------
<!doctype html>
---------------

- First row of code identifies the doctype that tells browser how to interpret code
- HTML5 embeds the DTD instead of trying to call it in

------
<html>
------

- <html> is where the code starts and </html> is where the code ends

------
<head>
------

- Admin information about where file is located
- One meta tag to define character set and a <title> element in the <head>
- Anything in <head> will not be visible on the web page but describes and defines the webpage
- <head> holds information about file and <body> holds information about what is displayed

------
<body>
------

- Place content that you want people to see when file is opened in browser

--------------
.htm or .html?
--------------

- Difference goes back to W95 and ISO9660 level 1 standard where no file names longer than 8 characters and extension no longer than 3 characters
- Level 2 ISO extended filenames and extensions
- Microsoft continues to use .htm
- Microsoft status within web community is not good

-----------------
Elements and Tags
-----------------

- HTML code written using elements or tags
- An element is made up of open tag, close tag, and content between
- Interaction described in HTML's Document Type Definition (DTD) built into HTML5 compliant browser
- This is the first line of the html code with <!doctype html>
- Tag is either opening or closing element without opposing element or element's content
- Tag is one part of an element
- <h1> is open </h1> is close
- HTML code must follow HTML5 DTD
- HTML does best to fix non-compliant tags and render text based on code as it was fixed

----------------
Case Sensitivity
----------------

- HTML not case-sensitive, but in page it should be
- Convention is lowercase

-------------
Body Text <p>
-------------

- Normal body text that is not a header, list item, or other
- Text in <p> element is 1 em tall
- Paragraph technically has one em of space between paragraphs

---------------
Header Elements
---------------

- Defines a title to a section of text
- <h1> is first title, etc.

---------------
<p> versus <br>
---------------

- If you want to go to next line but no additional space between lines that paragraphs add, use <br>

-------
Display
-------

- Defines how element interacts or lays out with other elements
- Block: element consumes entire line and will not allow content beside it or inline, so it consumes only space it takes up

-----------------------------------------
Spaces between Characters (HTML Entities)
-----------------------------------------

- Allowed no more than one space between characters in HTML
- Workaround is `&nbsp` which is a non-breaking space
- This is referred to as an entity

=======================================
Changing the Appearance of Page Content
=======================================

- <!doctype html> defines default styles applied to your webpage
- Styles can be written at three different levels
- Inline style applies only to element where style is added
- Will begin to expand to page-based sty
les (embedded) and then site-based styles (external)
- Inline style this week will be changing the color of text and for centering
- Inline style is held in attribute that sits inside element we're changing

<p style = "color: red">This is red</p>
<p>This is not red</p>

- Attribute of color red is known key-value pair
- To change alignment of text, use text-align

<p style = "text-align: center">Some text</p>
<p>More text</p>

<!doctype html>: Applies default styles <h1>, <h2>, and <p> tags

<html lang = "us">: written language setting
<meta charset = 'utf-8'>: Binary converts following map of UTF-8 characters
<title>: Text label for browser window
<h1 style = 'text-align: center'>Page Title</h1>: Title is centered on page and can align accordingly
<p style = 'color: green'>First Line</p>: text originally black but now green
<p style = 'color: purple; text-align: right'>Fourth Line</p>: Text purple and right-aligned 

- 16 basic colors in 140 named colors in HTML
- Have universak definitions, but 124 may have different color mixes in different browsers
- Use the hexidecimal code
