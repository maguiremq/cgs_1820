=======================
Disruptive Technologies
=======================

- Makes old products obsolete
- Destroys old industry
- Affects social order, law, and societal morals
- Less expensive
- Moves centralized power towards decentralizaton

- Internet replaced printing
- Printing was once disruptive to feudal system and church
- 1450's when Gutenburg started mass book production
- Power goes from church to publishers
- Disruptive to truth since internet contains opinions or statements that are untrue

- Internet started as means to send papers and data within CERN
- Invented by Tim Berners-Lee

==================
What is a browser?
==================

- Views web pages
- Application that renders web page by source HTML and CSS code
- Gets sent to frame buffer (video card)
- HTML5 in 2005 led to standards across browsing experience
- All browsers use W3C Document Object Model to describe page structure, style, and content, except for Microsoft Edge
- Browsers designed to convert invalid code to valid code

------------------
Browser Components 
------------------

- Browsers use series of engines/programming modules to display web page
- An engine is a block of code that performs a specific task
- Browser has rendering or layout engine that calculates pixel colors on frame buffer.

================================
Important Browser Considerations
================================

---------------------
Document Object Model
---------------------

-DOM not an engine but represents web page structure for rendering engine.

----------------------
Separation of Concerns
----------------------

- SOC calls for one file to hold only one type of scripting
- Principle shared in engineering disciplines
- Three types of scripting to make webpage
- HTML is also known as structure - it defines pages content
- Cascading Style Sheets/styling information are known as presentation - defines page
s appearance
- Javascript adds programming and dynamism to web pages

- Separation of concerns should be followed in HTML because browser parses code quickly

===================
Browsers Used Today
===================

- Chrome has 66% of market share.
- Most compliant with W3C standards.
- Requires each tab to run as separate instance

- Safari is second with 18% of market share.
- Mobile browsing not separated from desktop browsing

- Edge started as internet explorer
- Controversial because directly embedded in the Windows 95 OS.
- Has 5% of market share

- Firefox started as netscape navigator and dominated 1995 - 2000.
- Netscape navigator 2 important because it was the first browser to store cookies, allow Javascript, and it introduced SSL
- Replaced in 2004 for Firefox
- 3% of market share

=================================
The World of ECMAScript Companies
=================================

-------------------------------------
Technologies Relating to the Internet
-------------------------------------

- John Resig focused on UI, front-end development, and Javascript
- Created jQuery library and considered leading voice in Javascript development
- jQuery used by 10% of companies that need programming framework to use on site

- ECMA stands for European Computer Manufacturers Association and it is standardization organization where JavaScript and client-side scripting languages are documented

- Companies discussed are Adobe, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Opera
