		<h2>Florida Caverns State Park</h2>

				class="right" />
			Cool air, the sound of dripping water, a visual array of
			mystifying stalactites, stalagmites, flowstones and draperies -
			this is what greets visitors when they explore the otherworldly
			depths of Florida Caverns. Florida Caverns offers visitors a
			rarity in the state, a chance to explore stunning caves. While
			moving between the large underground rooms, one can observe the
			many chisel marks made by 1930s-era Civilian Conservation Corps
			workers. These hard-working men enlarged the cave passageways
			by hand so visitors could stand upright during the guided
			tours. They also built the park’s spacious visitor center.
			We are excited to welcome everyone to visit the awe-inspiring
			splendor of Florida Caverns State Park. This is one of the
			few state parks with dry (air-filled) caves and is the only
			state park in Florida to offer cave tours to the public. The
			Florida Cavern has dazzling formations of limestone stalactites,
			stalagmites, soda straws, flowstones and draperies. The Chipola
			River and Blue Hole spring provide areas for fishing, canoeing
			and boating. Florida Caverns State Park is popular for camping,
			picnicking, fishing, hiking, and horseback riding. The park
			does not rent horses, however stables are available for
			equestrian enthusiasts. The park also features a nine-hole,
			New Deal-era golf course set in beautiful rolling terrain.
			The entrance is adjacent to the main park entrance; contact
			the Florida Caverns Golf Course at (850) 526-1148. Guided cave
			tours are offered year round except Thanksgiving and Christmas.
			Guided tours of the Florida Cavern lasts 45 minutes and is
			considered to be moderately strenuous. An audiovisual program
			about touring the cave and other natural areas of the park is available in the visitor center. Camping
			reservations may be made by visiting ReserveAmerica.com or by calling Reserve America at (800) 326-3521, TDD
			(888) 433-0287.

		<h2>Ichetucknee Springs State Park</h2>
		<p><img src="images/is01.png" width="210" height="247" alt="Ichetucknee River" title="Bring or rent a float!"
				class="right" />
			Traveling the pristine waters of the Ichetucknee River is the perfect outing, whether you’re looking for a
			vigorous adventure or a relaxing day on the water. Although well-known for its warm weather tubing,
			Ichetucknee
			Springs State Park is a 2,669-acre wildlife haven where beaver, otter, gar, softshell turtle, wild turkey,
			wood
			duck and limpkin all find a home. The main draw is the park’s eight major crystal-clear springs that join to
			create the 6-mile Ichetucknee River. The upper portion within the state park is a National Natural Landmark,
			perhaps the most pristine spring run in the state and best enjoyed by canoe or kayak during the cooler
			months.
			Three nature trails guide visitors through the lush park forest or a majestic sandhill environment with
			towering
			longleaf pines. Many visitors at Ichetucknee Springs State Park are surprised by the sheer amount of
			wildlife
			and diversity that is to be found here. It is easy to believe that the park is a crown jewel of the Florida
			Park
			Service, not only because of its fantastic tubing and river access, but also because of the pristine
			habitats
			and classification as one of the 15 largest spring groups in the state. On any given day, you might hear the
			hoot of an owl far overhead, smell the fresh scent of the plants after a rainstorm or enjoy the sight of
			turtles
			jockeying for position on the best log in the river.</p>

			<img src="images/jd02.png" width="210" height="247" alt="Jonathan Dickinson"
				title="This one is named after a person!" class="left" />
			Sixteen distinct natural communities create the mosaic that is Jonathan Dickinson, the largest state park in
			Southeast Florida. Rare environments such as coastal sand hills, upland lakes and scrub forests as well as
			the
			pristine Loxahatchee River make this park a unique spot to explore on land or by water. Historical interests
			include a secret World War II training camp, the story of the shipwrecked Quaker merchant who is the park’s
			namesake, and Trapper Nelson, the legendary Wild Man of the Loxahatchee. Ranger-guided tours of Trapper
			Nelson’s
			1930s pioneer homestead are available year-round. Visitors can enjoy paved and off-road biking, equestrian
			and
			hiking trails. Boating, canoeing and kayaking along the river are also great ways to enjoy the park. Anglers
			can
			fish along the riverbank or from a boat. The nature and history of the park come to life through exhibits
			and
			displays in the Elsa Kimbell Environmental Education and Research Center. Programs for kids or the whole
			family
			are also offered here. Sign up for our friends group e-newsletter to learn more about programs and events.
			Nestled in the heart of South Florida, Jonathan Dickinson State Park is a haven of natural beauty and rich
			history. As a dedicated non-profit organization, The Friends of Jonathan Dickinson State Park are committed
			to
			preserving this precious ecosystem for future generations. Our efforts focus on enhancing the park’s natural
			and
			cultural resources through community engagement, educational programs, and conservation initiatives. Every

			outreach.

			difference—join us as a member, volunteer, or donor and be a part of preserving one of Florida's most
