			<p>We finally have the ability to celebrate National Bubble Bath Day in the United States and Mexico.</p>
			<p>We established a day to celebrate bubble baths this year. Bubble baths have reinvented the bathing routine, and sitting in a pit of bubbles is incredibly enjoyable for adults and children alike. Bubble Baths are proven to ameliorate stress, depression, and anxiety.</p>
			<p>They are also using bubble baths in experimental treatment for health conditions like Parkinsons, Kidney Failure, and Sepsis.</p>

			<p>Teddy Bear Day is one of the most important holidays in the continguous United States.</p>
			<p>Territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and others are not allowed to celebrate the Teddy Bear Holiday because teddy bears cant fathom what a territory means. Failing to understand what a territory is, the national teddy bear administration refuses to allow territories to celebrate due to uncertainty regarding the aggression that teddy bears display with members of territories.</p>
			<p>Teddy bears have been the backbone of this country since the 19th century. Teddy bears were on the frontline during the Civil War and the Vietnam war.</p>
