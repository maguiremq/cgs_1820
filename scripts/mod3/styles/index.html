		<p>Make planning your next big adventure a piece of cake with a Florida vacation package. Whether it's history, nature or something else entirely that draws you to this destination, our package deals will help you experience it all. Start your trip to Florida with a few days in Orlando. Families staying here highly rate Universal Studios Florida and Universal’s Islands of Adventure. Miami is another city that draws crowds from near and far. If you're treating your significant other to a romantic getaway, head to Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County and Miami River. Expedia is a one-stop shop when it comes to planning your Florida vacation. From flights and hotels, to rental cars and more, we're here to help you create a travel experience like no other.</p>
		<p>Your mission, should you accept it, is to totally immerse yourself and your crew in your Space Coast vacation. Space Coast beaches are the closest to Orlando and your luxury vacation villa. You can easily make a day of hanging out with famous astronauts, dining on delicious, fresh seafood with a view of the Atlantic, or relaxing on beautiful strands. This magnificent stretch of coastline is known as "Florida’s largest manatee and sea turtle habitats in one of the most diverse ecosystems in the western hemisphere" and it truly is remarkable.</p>
		<p>When you visit, you’ll find that some include tours of the packing house, others include a walk through the orange groves in Florida where you can hand-pick fresh oranges from the tree, a few will feature on-site restaurants, and nearly all include retail stores where you’ll find orange blossom honey, candies, ice cream fudge, and a wide assortment of Florida souvenirs with a citrus twist. Keep in mind that some orchard operations are closed off-season (and sometimes on weekends), so be sure to check in advance before you visit one of these orange farms in Florida.</p>
