Michael Maguire - Module 8

Instructions:

1. Use RWD to position the story of "Sleepy Hollow" above "Rip Van Winkle".

    - When the screen's width is 80em or less and beside "Rip Van Winkle when 
        the screen is wider than 80em. The  main layer is not to get larger 
        than 122 em.

2. The sections that hold the two stories: 

    - Are never to get wider than 60em
    - They are to be centered horizontally within the main layer 
    - Each section will have .5em space between it and the <main> edge
        and 1em of total space between it and the other section.
