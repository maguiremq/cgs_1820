		<p><strong>This element is supposed to be listed as strong</strong></p>
		<p><em>This element is supposed to be emphasized to show that it is important</em></p>
		<br>
		<p><small>This element is small so it may be included in fine print or is not important</small><p>
		<p>This is my fourth sentence and I have four divided by two dogs in my house<p>
		<hr>
		<ol style = 'list-style-type: square'>
			<li>This is the first bullet and we will use a square</li>
			<li>You guessed it: this is the second bullet and we are still using squares
			<ul style = 'list-style-type: circle'>
				<li>We need to ensure that this bullet uses a circle</li>
				<li>In fact, the entire sublist needs to use circles</li>
				<li>One day we may use diamonds or em dashes for a sublist</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>It is required in the homework that we include a sublist between the second and third items</li>
			<li>Look, I think we are done with this list</li>
		</ol>
		<ol style = 'list-style-type: upper-roman' start = '4'>
			<li>Guess what? Now we need to create an eight-item list!</li>
			<li>This eight-item list is supposed to start at four</li>
			<li>We are also attempting to use upper-case Roman Numerals to differentiate the lists</li>
			<li>Given that this is the fourth element, it only makes sense to add another one for the assignment</li>
			<li>Darn! We have to add another list item so we can move onto the next list
			<ul style = 'list-style-type: lower-alpha'>
				<li>It is important that we deviate from Roman Numerals and start using lowercase letters</li>
				<li>Sublists generally provide more detail for an item in the list</li>
				<li>The detail often helps me understand things that make up the adult list</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Thankfully, we have completed the items in the sublist</li>
			<li>There are fun events where people use a car to do figure eights on a track</li>
			<li>The cars are usually beat up, and my 2009 Camry is so beat up that it embarrasses my wife</li>
